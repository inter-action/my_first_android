android notes:

  Create a colors.xml file in res/values.



  android tint - is controlled by colorAccent

  android selectable

  ? vs @ in resource file referencing

    When referencing a concrete value in XML, such as a color, you use the @ notation.
    @color/gray points to a specific resource.

    When referencing a resource in the theme, you use the ? notation.

  android svgs:

    Vector Asset Studio:-

     When you specify an SVG file, Vector Asset Studio gives immediate feedback about whether
     the graphics code is supported or not. If the SVG code is supported, it converts the file
     into an XML file containing VectorDrawable code.



      We recommend that you limit a vector image to a maximum of 200 x 200 dp; otherwise, it can take too long to draw.


      with tint color:
        you can add a tint to the vector drawable that you placed in a layout, and the icon color
        changes to the tint color. If the icon color isn't black, the icon color
        might instead blend with the tint color
